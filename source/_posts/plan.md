**Introduction to My Development Journey**

As I embark on creating my first full-stack application—a To-Do List—I've decided to follow a structured 7-week development plan, created with the assistance of ChatGPT. While I acknowledge that there may be bumps along the way due to my novice status in full-stack development, I’m ready to tackle this challenge head-on. This plan isn't just a guide; it's a learning opportunity. I anticipate making mistakes, which is all part of the learning curve. By the end of this journey, I aim to have a solid foundation to build upon and refine in future projects.

Stay tuned as I blindly follow this initial plan, learning and adapting along the way to eventually craft a more seasoned approach in subsequent projects.

### Week 1: Setup and Initial Planning

-   **Setup Development Environment:** Install necessary software and tools on macOS.
-   **Version Control Initialization:** Set up Git repositories on GitHub, including branch management strategies.
-   **Docker Configuration:** Write Dockerfiles and docker-compose.yml for containerizing both frontend and backend.
-   **CI/CD Pipeline Setup:** Initialize CI/CD using GitHub Actions or Jenkins to automate the build, test, and deploy process.
-   **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) Session:** Conduct a BDD session to define and model how the application should behave in various scenarios.
-   **Begin TDD Frameworks:** Establish TDD environments using Jest, React Testing Library for the frontend, and NUnit/xUnit for the backend. Write initial tests to guide development.

### Week 2: Backend Development Part 1

-   **API Design and Development:** Using DDD insights, define and start implementing REST API endpoints using .NET.
-   **Database Design and Implementation:** Model the SQL database reflecting the domain model, set up initial migrations.
-   **Initial API Testing:** Write tests for the newly implemented APIs under the TDD approach.
-   **CI/CD Pipeline Enhancement:** Configure the CI/CD pipeline to automate backend tests and database integration.

### Week 3: Backend Development Part 2

-   **Complete API Implementation:** Finish all backend functionalities with corresponding unit and integration tests.
-   **WebSocket Implementation:** Integrate WebSockets for real-time functionalities.
-   **CI/CD for Real-Time Services:** Ensure WebSocket implementations are covered by automated tests and deployment strategies.
-   **Backend Dockerization:** Finalize Docker setup for the backend, ensuring smooth deployment through the CI/CD pipeline.

### Week 4: Frontend Development Part 1

-   **Frontend Setup:** Initialize the React project with Mantine, Redux, and setup dark theme.
-   **Initial Component Development:** Build core UI components and setup state management using Redux.
-   **Frontend Testing:** Implement BDD for UI components.
-   **Frontend CI/CD Integration:** Setup CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment of frontend changes.

### Week 5: Frontend Development Part 2

-   **Advanced UI Features:** Develop interactive and responsive features for task manipulation and viewing.
-   **Integration with Backend:** Connect frontend with API endpoints and ensure WebSocket data is handled correctly.
-   **Enhanced Frontend Testing:** Expand BDD tests to cover new features and interactions.
-   **Refine Frontend Deployment:** Ensure the frontend deploys seamlessly via CI/CD, adjusting Docker settings as needed for optimal performance.

### Week 6: Integration and Additional Features

-   **Full System Integration Testing:** Perform comprehensive integration tests across both frontend and backend.
-   **Add Additional Features:** Implement additional features like user authentication, notifications, or task filters, based on progress and remaining time.
-   **Optimize CI/CD Workflows:** Fine-tune the CI/CD process for smooth full-stack integration and deployment.
-   **Documentation and Code Refinement:** Start updating documentation and refactor code for better maintainability and performance.

### Week 7: Testing, Debugging, and Deployment

-   **End-to-End Testing:** Conduct thorough end-to-end testing using both TDD and BDD methodologies.
-   **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** Get feedback from potential users and make necessary adjustments.
-   **Final Debugging and Optimization:** Address any remaining issues and optimize overall system performance.
-   **Final Deployment:** Deploy the complete application using the established CI/CD pipeline.
-   **Project Documentation:** Finalize all project documentation to ensure clarity for future maintenance and development.
