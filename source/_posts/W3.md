### Day 1: Completing Unit Tests for the Backend

Today marked significant progress as I successfully completed the unit testing for the backend of my To-Do List application, setting a strong pace for the week. The journey began with a bit of a hiccup as I spent some time deliberating over which tools to use for testing. I soon realized that the core concepts across different testing tools are quite similar, leading me to the insight that it's best to choose one tool and fully commit to it.

**Tool Selection and Setup:**

-   **NUnit:** I selected NUnit as my primary unit testing framework due to its robust features and widespread acceptance in the .NET community.
-   **Moq:** To handle dependency mocking, I opted for Moq, which proved invaluable in simulating the behavior of complex dependencies.
-   **Fluent Assertions:** I integrated Fluent Assertions to enhance the readability and maintainability of the assertions, finding it more intuitive compared to the standard NUnit assertions.

**Testing Strategy:**
During the development of the tests, I deepened my understanding of the relationships among model files, DTOs, and repository files. Implementing tests using the traditional AAA (Arrange, Act, Assert) pattern helped structure my tests clearly and effectively.

One key change I made in the application was shifting the data type of the ID from integer to string, utilizing UUIDs for setting IDs. This change provides greater flexibility and better alignment with modern application standards.

**What I Learned:**

-   **Tool Consistency:** It's crucial to pick a tool and stick with it to avoid wasting time and effort.
-   **Mocking with Moq:** Leveraging Moq to simulate repository interactions allows for more focused and effective testing.
-   **AAA Pattern:** The Arrange-Act-Assert pattern is a powerful structure for writing clear and concise unit tests.
-   **ID Flexibility:** Using strings for IDs, set by UUID, offers flexibility and simplifies integration across diverse systems.
-   **Bidirectional Testing:** When testing functionalities like task creation, it's important to validate both directions of data mapping with AutoMapper â€” from DTO to model and vice versa.

Today was a productive start to the week, solidifying the backend's stability and readiness for integration with the frontend. As I move forward, I am equipped with powerful tools and strategies to ensure the quality and reliability of the application.
