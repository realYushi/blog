### Day 1: Completing Unit Tests for the Backend

Today marked significant progress as I successfully completed the unit testing for the backend of my To-Do List application, setting a strong pace for the week. The journey began with a bit of a hiccup as I spent some time deliberating over which tools to use for testing. I soon realized that the core concepts across different testing tools are quite similar, leading me to the insight that it's best to choose one tool and fully commit to it.

**Tool Selection and Setup:**

-   **NUnit:** I selected NUnit as my primary unit testing framework due to its robust features and widespread acceptance in the .NET community.
-   **Moq:** To handle dependency mocking, I opted for Moq, which proved invaluable in simulating the behavior of complex dependencies.
-   **Fluent Assertions:** I integrated Fluent Assertions to enhance the readability and maintainability of the assertions, finding it more intuitive compared to the standard NUnit assertions.

**Testing Strategy:**
During the development of the tests, I deepened my understanding of the relationships among model files, DTOs, and repository files. Implementing tests using the traditional AAA (Arrange, Act, Assert) pattern helped structure my tests clearly and effectively.

One key change I made in the application was shifting the data type of the ID from integer to string, utilizing UUIDs for setting IDs. This change provides greater flexibility and better alignment with modern application standards.

**What I Learned:**

-   **Tool Consistency:** It's crucial to pick a tool and stick with it to avoid wasting time and effort.
-   **Mocking with Moq:** Leveraging Moq to simulate repository interactions allows for more focused and effective testing.
-   **AAA Pattern:** The Arrange-Act-Assert pattern is a powerful structure for writing clear and concise unit tests.
-   **ID Flexibility:** Using strings for IDs, set by UUID, offers flexibility and simplifies integration across diverse systems.
-   **Bidirectional Testing:** When testing functionalities like task creation, it's important to validate both directions of data mapping with AutoMapper — from DTO to model and vice versa.

Today was a productive start to the week, solidifying the backend's stability and readiness for integration with the frontend. As I move forward, I am equipped with powerful tools and strategies to ensure the quality and reliability of the application.

### Day 2: Completing the Service Layer and Exploring Integration Tests

Today was another intensive day of learning and development on my To-Do List application. As I dive deeper into Test-Driven Development (TDD), I’m appreciating how it sharpens my focus and enhances my productivity. TDD's iterative process of writing tests, passing them, and then refactoring ensures that I only concentrate on what's essential at the moment. This approach has been so effective that I plan to extend it to the frontend development to bolster my coding practices there as well.

**Service Layer and Repository Concerns:**
The service layer came together straightforwardly; however, I encountered a conceptual challenge when deciding where to place the database commit function. Initially, I thought it best to leave it within the repository layer, as it directly involves data access. Yet, after further research, I realized that moving it to the service layer—or potentially the controller—would allow for managing multiple transactions more effectively.

This revelation led me down the rabbit hole into the "unit of work" pattern. Although I first felt it was an overdesign—given that EF Core already implements this pattern internally—the prospect of potentially integrating other ORMs like Dapper or managing multiple databases in the future convinced me of its value. Thus, I've decided to incorporate this pattern into my project, seeing it as an excellent opportunity to prepare for more complex scenarios and enhance my architectural knowledge.

**Dependency Injection and Tools:**
The multi-layered architecture, while robust, introduced complexities in manually managing dependencies within `program.cs`. I discovered Autofac, a tool that automates the wiring of dependencies by registering all services and repositories in a container. This simplifies the entire setup, as I only need to register this container in `program.cs`. Another approach I'm considering is utilizing built-in dependency injection with extension methods, which also promises a streamlined way to manage service lifecycles and dependencies.

**What I Learned Today:**

1. **The Efficiency of TDD:** TDD not only helps write better code but also boosts productivity by focusing development efforts on passing tests and achieving green states before refactoring.
2. **Service Layer Responsibilities:** The placement of the commit save function in the service layer can enhance transaction management across services.
3. **Unit of Work Pattern:** Adopting this pattern can future-proof the application against changes in ORM technologies or database management strategies.
4. **Autofac for Dependency Management:** Autofac is an invaluable tool for automating dependency injections, reducing manual setup, and ensuring cleaner code.
5. **Using Extension Methods:** They offer a practical way to organize and register services and repositories in the DI container.

As I continue with the integration testing tomorrow, I'm excited to apply these new structures and tools to see how they contribute to a more robust and maintainable application architecture.

### Days 3 and 4: Navigating Integration Testing and Finalizing the Repository Layer

The last two days have deepened my understanding of integration testing and allowed me to complete the repository layer of my To-Do List application. My journey through integration testing was more challenging than anticipated, offering valuable insights into handling real-world scenarios in software testing.

**Challenges with Integration Testing:**
Initially, I assumed that integration testing would be similar to unit testing but with a broader scope. However, the complexities of using real data and interacting with an actual database introduced new challenges. Unlike unit tests, where mock data can be employed, integration tests require manipulation of real data in the database. This involves not only creating and testing this data but also cleaning up the database post-testing to maintain a consistent state for future tests.

**Database Considerations:**
A significant decision was choosing the right database for testing. While it's possible to use lighter databases like SQLite or even in-memory databases, I discovered that these might not replicate the production environment accurately due to differences in how EF Core translates LINQ to SQL. To mirror production conditions closely, using the same database as in production is ideal. However, setting this up, especially in a CI/CD pipeline, posed its own set of challenges.

**Solution with TestContainers:**
Fortunately, I discovered TestContainers, a tool that simplifies this process by providing disposable Docker containers for databases during testing. This allowed me to use the exact same database setup for both production and testing environments seamlessly across local development and CI/CD pipelines. TestContainers proved to be an exceptionally powerful and convenient solution for managing database states during tests.

**Repository Layer Development:**
For the repository layer, the focus was on implementing straightforward CRUD operations. I debated between using the `Attach` and `Find` methods provided by EF Core for handling database entities. Ultimately, I chose the `Find` method for most operations due to its clarity and safety, although I considered using `Attach` in less critical areas to optimize performance.

**Transactional Management:**
During integration tests, managing transactions effectively was crucial. I utilized `TransactionScope` to handle transactions, allowing each test to roll back changes after execution. This ensured that the database remained in a clean state for each test, preventing side effects between tests.

**What I Learned:**

1. **Complexity of Integration Tests:** Integration testing involves complexities beyond those encountered in unit testing, especially when real data and databases are involved.
2. **Database Strategy for Testing:** The importance of using the same database system as production to ensure that tests accurately reflect real-world usage.
3. **Utility of TestContainers:** This tool is invaluable for setting up disposable, consistent database environments for testing.
4. **Transactional Control:** Using `TransactionScope` to manage and isolate transactions during tests ensures that the database state is consistent and clean.
5. **CRUD in Repository Layer:** Implementing CRUD operations is straightforward but requires careful consideration of the methods used for optimal clarity and safety.

As I move forward, the experiences and tools I've embraced over these two days have significantly bolstered my confidence in handling both the development and testing of complex, database-driven applications.

### Days 5, 6, 7: Completing Controller Layer, Implementing Security, and Refactoring

This week was a pivotal period in the development of my To-Do List application, as I completed the controller layer, integrated robust authentication and authorization mechanisms, and engaged in extensive refactoring to enhance the project’s architecture.

**Controller Development and Security Enhancements:**
While developing the controller, I realized I had not initially included design considerations for authentication and authorization. This oversight led me to revisit and refactor several components:

-   **Database and Model Adjustments:** I updated my `DbContext`, models, and DTOs, adding new fields and changing some data types from strings to enums for better clarity and maintainability. Data annotations were applied to ensure that all data adheres to defined validation rules.
-   **Security Implementation:** The distinction between authentication (verifying user identity) and authorization (granting access to resources) became clear as I worked on implementing these features. I chose to use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication, as they do not require server-side storage, enhancing scalability and simplifying token management. I also opted to store JWTs in cookies to automate token handling securely.

-   **Password Management:** An essential security aspect that nearly slipped through was password management. To address this, I implemented bcrypt for hashing passwords, ensuring that user credentials are stored securely. The bcrypt library's verify function is used to authenticate users during login.

**Architectural Decisions:**

-   **Repository Pattern:** After revisiting the unit of work pattern, I found it unnecessarily complicated the code and made it harder to maintain, leading to its removal. However, the repository pattern has proven beneficial and remains a part of the architecture.
-   **Refactoring:** Continuous refactoring played a critical role this week, not only to integrate authentication and authorization but also to improve the overall design and structure of the code. This process has significantly boosted the application's maintainability and performance.

**Reflections and Next Steps:**
The journey from planning to having a fully operational backend was enlightening, with major lessons learned in securing and structuring a web application. What's remarkable is the rapidity with which the backend came together once the foundational pieces were in place—a testament to thorough planning and understanding.

As I prepare to start on the frontend next week, I'm excited to see how quickly I can bring the entire application together. My goal is to complete the frontend within two weeks, fully integrating it with the backend to see my application running on my computer.

**What I Learned:**

1. **Importance of Security:** Integrating secure authentication and authorization mechanisms is crucial for protecting the application and its users.
2. **Benefits of Refactoring:** Regularly revising and improving code enhances its readability, maintainability, and performance.
3. **Data Integrity:** Data annotations are invaluable for maintaining data integrity and enforcing business rules.
4. **Efficiency of JWT:** Using JWTs simplifies authentication processes and enhances application security.
5. **Necessity of Password Security:** Implementing bcrypt for password hashing is essential for safeguarding user data.
6. **Convenience of Cookies:** Storing authentication tokens in cookies can streamline user sessions and enhance security.
7. **Practicality of bcrypt:** Utilizing bcrypt for password hashing and verification ensures robust security measures are in place.

This week has laid a robust foundation for the upcoming frontend development, setting the stage for a fully functional and secure application.
