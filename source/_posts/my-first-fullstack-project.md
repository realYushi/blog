**Embarking on My First Full-Stack Project: A To-Do List App**

I've decided to dive into the deep end for my first full-stack project by creating a To-Do list application. Here’s a rundown of the technology stack I'll be using:

**Front End:**

-   **Framework:** React with TypeScript
-   **State Management:** Redux (though it might be overkill, I'm excited to learn how to integrate it into a real project)
-   **UI Library:** Mainine (focusing on mobile responsiveness and theming capabilities)
-   **Build Tool:** Vite (to speed up development with its fast refresh capabilities)

**Back End:**

-   **Framework:** .NET
-   **Databases:** PostgreSQL for development and MSSQL for production
-   **ORM:** EF Core

Throughout the development process, I'll be experimenting with CI/CD to handle some tasks, enhancing my understanding of these systems. Additionally, I plan to implement TDD (Test-Driven Development) and BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) methodologies to guide the project structure.

The timeline for this project is set at seven weeks. As this is my initial foray into full-stack development, I aim to build out basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities. If time permits, I hope to add some advanced features to enhance the app's utility.

I'm fortunate to have access to tools like ChatGPT, which will help me stick to a structured seven-week plan, tackling the project step by step.

Once again, as this is my first full-stack project, I anticipate a steep learning curve and expect to face numerous challenges. However, I’m a firm believer in learning by doing—even if it means stepping out of my comfort zone. Let's do this!
