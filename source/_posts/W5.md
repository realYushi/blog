### Week 4: Frontend Development Part 2
-   **Advanced UI Features:** Develop interactive and responsive features for task manipulation and viewing.
-   **Integration with Backend:** Connect frontend with API endpoints and ensure WebSocket data is handled correctly.
-   **Enhanced Frontend Testing:** Expand BDD tests to cover new features and interactions.
-   **Refine Frontend Deployment:** Ensure the frontend deploys seamlessly via CI/CD, adjusting Docker settings as needed for optimal performance.

### Day 1: Refining Project Structure and Deepening Integration with Redux

Today, I took significant steps in refining the architecture of my To-Do List application, focusing on enhancing the integration with Redux and optimizing the organization of the project files.

**Project Restructuring:**
I reorganized the React components into a more intuitive structure:
- **Page-Based Components:** Components are now categorized based on the pages they are used on, which clarifies their roles within the application.
- **Common Folder:** A dedicated folder for shared components helps in maintaining DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles across the project.
- **Container and View Pattern:** By separating the logic from the presentation, I created container components that handle the logic and state, while the view components remain purely for presentation. This clear separation enhances maintainability and scalability.

**Centralizing Data Structures:**
Implementing data interfaces to define and standardize data structures proved invaluable, albeit a bit tedious. To streamline this process:
- **Model Folder:** I established a model folder that houses all data interfaces and types. This centralization allows for easier management and accessibility of the data structures used throughout the project.

**Enhancing Redux Integration:**
- **Redux Setup:** Successfully set up the Redux store, along with the necessary slices, reducers, and actions. This setup provides a robust framework for managing the global state.
- **API Integration:** To facilitate communication with the backend, I organized all API requests within a dedicated API folder.
- **Redux-Query Addition:** I integrated Redux-Query into the project to manage API requests more effectively. Redux-Query simplifies the handling of asynchronous operations and server state, aligning perfectly with Redux.

**What I Learned Today:**
1. **Redux Application:** Applying Redux has solidified my understanding of state management within a complex application, ensuring a predictable state across components.
2. **Redux-Query for API Requests:** The use of Redux-Query has streamlined the process of managing API calls, reducing complexity and increasing efficiency.
3. **Project Organization:** The reorganization of the project into a more structured format has significantly improved clarity and maintainability.
4. **Data Interface Utilization:** Using data interfaces to define data structures has helped in maintaining consistency and clarity in data handling throughout the application.
5. **Container and View Pattern:** Adopting this design pattern has reinforced the separation of concerns, making the code cleaner and more modular.

These enhancements not only improve the current state of the application but also set a strong foundation for future development and scalability. As I continue to build and refine the frontend, these practices will undoubtedly aid in maintaining a clean, efficient, and manageable codebase.
