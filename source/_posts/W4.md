### Week 4: Frontend Development Part 1

-   **Frontend Setup:** Initialize the React project with Mantine, Redux, and setup dark theme.
-   **Initial Component Development:** Build core UI components and setup state management using Redux.
-   **Frontend Testing:** Implement BDD for UI components.
-   **Frontend CI/CD Integration:** Setup CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment of frontend changes.

### Days 1 and 2: Setting Up the Frontend and Exploring UI Design Tools

The initial days of frontend development have been slower than anticipated as I navigated through the complexities of setting up the project and delving into UI libraries.

**Exploring UI Design with Figma:**
Initially, I underestimated the learning curve associated with Figma. My plan was to quickly pick up the tool within half a day and move straight into designing the UI for the application. However, I found that mastering Figma required much more time and effort than expected. The drag-and-drop interface, while intuitive for some, proved challenging as I prefer using keyboard shortcuts for efficiency. Despite the slow start, this experience emphasized the importance of properly learning a tool before fully integrating it into my workflow.

**Choosing the Right UI Library:**
Choosing a UI library was another area where I faced challenges. Initially, I thought it would be as simple as copying and pasting components into my project. However, I quickly realized that to effectively use a UI library, one must understand its core principles and integration techniques thoroughly. This realization led me to shift my focus from trying to implement a complex UI library to creating a basic wireframe that would guide the design process.

**Simplifying the Approach with Tailwind CSS:**
To keep the UI development manageable, I decided to use Tailwind CSS. This utility-first CSS framework will allow me to design a simple, yet effective interface without the overhead of mastering a new UI library immediately.

**Planning for Figma Mastery:**
Given the pivotal role of Figma in modern UI/UX design, I've added it to my future learning plans. Gaining proficiency in Figma will undoubtedly enhance my ability to design more visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces.

**What I Learned:**

1. **Figma’s Complexity:** Learning Figma is not as straightforward as I anticipated, requiring more dedicated time and practice.
2. **Understanding UI Libraries:** Utilizing UI libraries involves more than simple copy-pasting; it requires a deep understanding of their structures and styles.
3. **Importance of Wireframing:** Starting with a wireframe is crucial for establishing a clear design vision without getting lost in details.
4. **Step-by-Step Progress:** It's important to approach development methodically, avoiding the temptation to dive too deep into complex tools or libraries without adequate preparation.

These two days, though challenging, have set a clear path for how I will approach the frontend development. I'm looking forward to applying these lessons as I continue building out the user interface for my application.

### Days 3 and 4: Building Core UI Components and Exploring Layout Techniques

Over the past two days, I've made substantial progress on the UI layer of the To-Do List application. Although I initially lacked a clear vision for the component tree structure, I decided to start by constructing a single-page layout and planned to refactor it into reusable components later.

**Visual Layout Techniques:**
One practical technique I discovered while working with CSS was to outline all elements with a red border. This visual aid significantly improved my ability to see and adjust the layout of the page, making the structure of various elements more apparent and easier to manipulate.

**Exploring React Router:**
I experimented with React Router to implement SPA (Single Page Application) functionality. The SPA approach is intriguing due to its smooth user experience; however, the initial loading times raised some concerns. This will require further investigation to optimize performance and ensure a seamless user interaction.

**Responsive Design:**
The basic layout for mobile views is now complete and displaying perfectly. The ease of making designs responsive with Tailwind CSS has been a highlight, but more work is needed to adjust the layouts for desktop views. I plan to delve deeper into CSS Grid and Flexbox to enhance the flexibility and responsiveness of the layout.

**Refactoring for Reusability:**
The next step involves refining the existing components to make them more modular and reusable. This effort will not only streamline the current project but also improve maintainability and scalability for future developments.

**What I Learned:**

1. **Responsive Design with Grid and Flexbox:** These CSS techniques are crucial for creating flexible and responsive layouts. More research and practice with these tools will help me refine the application’s design.
2. **React Router Insights:** While powerful for creating SPAs, I need to further explore React Router, particularly how to manage initial loading times effectively.
3. **Tailwind CSS for Responsive Design:** Tailwind CSS has proven to be an invaluable tool for quickly implementing responsive designs. I plan to deepen my understanding of its capabilities to better utilize its features.
4. **Component Tree Design:** Designing an effective component tree is essential for building a scalable and maintainable application. I will focus more on this area to enhance the reusability of the components.

The last two days have been instrumental in shaping the visual and functional aspects of the application’s interface. As I continue refining the UI, the focus will remain on optimizing the design for both mobile and desktop, ensuring a robust and user-friendly experience.
