### Week 4: Frontend Development Part 1

-   **Frontend Setup:** Initialize the React project with Mantine, Redux, and setup dark theme.
-   **Initial Component Development:** Build core UI components and setup state management using Redux.
-   **Frontend Testing:** Implement BDD for UI components.
-   **Frontend CI/CD Integration:** Setup CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment of frontend changes.

### Days 1 and 2: Setting Up the Frontend and Exploring UI Design Tools

The initial days of frontend development have been slower than anticipated as I navigated through the complexities of setting up the project and delving into UI libraries.

**Exploring UI Design with Figma:**
Initially, I underestimated the learning curve associated with Figma. My plan was to quickly pick up the tool within half a day and move straight into designing the UI for the application. However, I found that mastering Figma required much more time and effort than expected. The drag-and-drop interface, while intuitive for some, proved challenging as I prefer using keyboard shortcuts for efficiency. Despite the slow start, this experience emphasized the importance of properly learning a tool before fully integrating it into my workflow.

**Choosing the Right UI Library:**
Choosing a UI library was another area where I faced challenges. Initially, I thought it would be as simple as copying and pasting components into my project. However, I quickly realized that to effectively use a UI library, one must understand its core principles and integration techniques thoroughly. This realization led me to shift my focus from trying to implement a complex UI library to creating a basic wireframe that would guide the design process.

**Simplifying the Approach with Tailwind CSS:**
To keep the UI development manageable, I decided to use Tailwind CSS. This utility-first CSS framework will allow me to design a simple, yet effective interface without the overhead of mastering a new UI library immediately.

**Planning for Figma Mastery:**
Given the pivotal role of Figma in modern UI/UX design, I've added it to my future learning plans. Gaining proficiency in Figma will undoubtedly enhance my ability to design more visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces.

**What I Learned:**

1. **Figmaâ€™s Complexity:** Learning Figma is not as straightforward as I anticipated, requiring more dedicated time and practice.
2. **Understanding UI Libraries:** Utilizing UI libraries involves more than simple copy-pasting; it requires a deep understanding of their structures and styles.
3. **Importance of Wireframing:** Starting with a wireframe is crucial for establishing a clear design vision without getting lost in details.
4. **Step-by-Step Progress:** It's important to approach development methodically, avoiding the temptation to dive too deep into complex tools or libraries without adequate preparation.

These two days, though challenging, have set a clear path for how I will approach the frontend development. I'm looking forward to applying these lessons as I continue building out the user interface for my application.
