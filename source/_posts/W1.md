### Week 1: Setup and Initial Planning

-   **Setup Development Environment:** Install necessary software and tools on macOS.
-   **Version Control Initialization:** Set up Git repositories on GitHub, including branch management strategies.
-   **Docker Configuration:** Write Dockerfiles and docker-compose.yml for containerizing both frontend and backend.
-   **CI/CD Pipeline Setup:** Initialize CI/CD using GitHub Actions or Jenkins to automate the build, test, and deploy process.
-   **Domain-Driven Design Session:** Conduct a session to define and model the domain, identifying key entities, value objects, aggregates, and bounded contexts.
-   **Begin TDD Frameworks:** Establish TDD environments using Jest, React Testing Library for the frontend, and NUnit/xUnit for the backend. Write initial tests to guide development.

### Day 1: Setting Up My Development Environment

Today marked the beginning of my journey in building a full-stack To-Do list application. I started by refreshing my workspace—an essential step to ensure everything runs smoothly. Here's a detailed breakdown of how I set up my development environment on my MacBook M1:

1. **Resetting My System:** To start with a clean slate, I reset everything and began setting up my development tools from scratch.

2. **Terminal and Shell Configuration:**

    - **Oh My Zsh:** Installed to customize and manage my zsh configuration efficiently.
    - **Warp:** Chosen as my terminal due to its user-friendly Vim key bindings.

3. **Package Management and Software Installation:**
    - **Homebrew:** Installed as the software manager to handle various installations.
    - **Mise:** Utilized for managing different runtime versions for various projects.
    - **Visual Studio Code (VSCode):** Selected as my primary code editor. I installed several extensions to enhance functionality, though I’m still considering whether to switch to Rider IDE for .NET development. For now, VSCode remains my choice.
    - **Postman:** Installed for API testing, a new tool for me, recommended by many developers.
    - **PostgreSQL:** Set up as the development database. Plans are in place to switch to MSSQL for production.
    - **Docker:** Installed to manage and maintain containerized applications.
    - **Local Git Configuration:** Set up for version control, including connecting to GitHub via SSH.
    - **Browsers and Developer Tools:**
        - **Chromium:** Installed along with React and Redux development tools to experiment with these technologies.

Today’s focus was primarily on establishing a robust and flexible development environment that will support the diverse technologies involved in my project. By the end of the day, I successfully:

-   Reset my system and configured my terminal using Oh My Zsh.
-   Managed software installations with Homebrew and runtime versions with Mise.
-   Prepared my IDE with necessary extensions and tools for backend and frontend development.
-   Set up essential services like PostgreSQL, Docker, and Postman for effective development practices.

This setup lays a solid foundation for the weeks to come, ensuring that I have all the tools I need at my disposal to tackle the challenges of building a full-stack application.
