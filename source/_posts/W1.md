### Day 2: Setting Up Git Repositories and Exploring Branch Management Strategies

Continuing with my development plan, today's focus shifted towards establishing a solid version control system. I took some significant steps to ensure that my project management and workflow are both efficient and effective.

**Establishing the GitHub Repository:**

I created a new repository for my To-Do List project, which can be found [here](https://github.com/realYushi/todo-list). Although the repository is currently empty, I'm confident it will soon be filled with the progress of my application. With ChatGPT's help, I crafted a well-structured README file to provide an overview of the project.

**Branch Management:**

Given that this is a solo project, I opted for a straightforward branch management strategy:

-   **Main:** Serves as the production branch.
-   **Development:** This is where all ongoing development will be merged and tested.
-   **Feature/newFeature:** Used for developing new features. Once features are stable, they will be merged into the 'Development' branch and eventually into 'Main' for production.
-   **Hotfix:** For emergency fixes, which will also follow the path of merging back to 'Main' and be deleted post-merge to maintain cleanliness in the repository.

During my research, I stumbled upon an intriguing tool called OpenCommit, which utilizes ChatGPT to analyze git diffs and generate meaningful commit messages. Intrigued by its capabilities, I decided to incorporate it into my workflow to see how AI can enhance traditional coding practices.

Additionally, I utilized gitignore.io to generate a comprehensive `.gitignore` file, ensuring that unnecessary files don’t clutter the repository.

**What I Learned Today:**

-   **Repository Setup:** I learned how to create a new repository on GitHub and link it to my local environment.
-   **Branch Management:** I gained insights into managing branches effectively for a streamlined development process.
-   **AI Integration:** Experimented with AI tools like OpenCommit to automate and refine commit messages.
-   **Project Hygiene:** Utilized tools to generate a `.gitignore` file, keeping my repository clean from unwanted files.

Today was about laying the groundwork for a seamless development process that incorporates both traditional practices and innovative AI tools. I’m excited to see how these tools will enhance my workflow as I move forward with the project.

### Day 3: Docker Configuration and Learning the CI/CD Workflow

Today's progress focused on setting up Docker for both the front-end and back-end components of my To-Do List application. Although I only created four files, the learning curve was steep and extremely rewarding.

**Key Configurations:**

-   **Dockerfiles:** I crafted separate Dockerfiles for the front-end and back-end folders. This process felt like assembling a new machine—each Dockerfile scripts the setup of a new environment, essentially virtualizing a clean slate where my code can run. This helps mitigate the notorious "it works on my machine" problem.
-   **Docker Compose:** At the root of the project, I added a Docker Compose file, which manages how Docker containers are built from the Dockerfiles and how they interact.
-   **Environment Variables:** I learned to use `.env` files to manage sensitive information securely. By adding these to the `.gitignore` file, I ensure that secret keys and passwords stay out of the version-controlled codebase.

**CI/CD Integration:**
The workflow I'm learning involves several steps:

1. Write and compile code locally within Docker to ensure consistency across environments.
2. Push the code to GitHub, triggering a CI/CD process that builds Docker images and pushes them to DockerHub.
3. Once the code is production-ready, I deploy it by creating a new container in Azure, pulling the latest Docker image from DockerHub.
4. The application then goes live, hosted seamlessly on Azure.

**What I Learned Today:**

1. **Dockerfile Structure:** I learned that each stage in a Dockerfile is distinct, necessitating the use of the `COPY` command to transfer artifacts from one stage to another.
2. **Docker Compose Updates:** The new Docker Compose v2 format has simplified some aspects, notably eliminating the need for a version statement at the start of the file.
3. **Security with `.env` Files:** These files are crucial for separating sensitive information from other project files, enhancing security.
4. **Full Workflow Clarity:** The day ended with a much clearer understanding of how Docker and Azure will interact in my CI/CD pipeline, giving me confidence in the robustness of my deployment strategy.

Today was about building the foundations of a reliable development environment and deployment workflow. Understanding Docker's role in development and deployment has been enlightening, and I'm excited to see how these configurations will support my project's growth.

### Day 4: Setting Up the CI/CD Pipeline

Today was a pivotal day in the development of my To-Do List application as I completed the setup of my CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. I crafted three action files tailored for the frontend, backend, and Docker image pushing processes.

**Challenges and Solutions:**

-   **Handling .env Files:** Initially, I struggled with managing `.env` files since they contain sensitive information and shouldn't be public. I learned that within the CI/CD process, I could dynamically create `.env` files using environment variables stored securely in GitHub. This discovery allows me to use `.env` files both locally and in the CI/CD pipeline without exposing sensitive data.

-   **Optimization vs. Local Resources:** I noticed that the CI/CD process on GitHub Actions runs at a similar speed to my local setup. Given my machine's limitations, this observation led me to reconsider the necessity of a dedicated local CI/CD setup. For now, I’ve decided that leveraging GitHub Actions is sufficient and more resource-efficient.

-   **Docker Image Tagging:** Tagging and managing Docker images presented another challenge. Since a single Docker Hub repository cannot hold two images, I needed a strategy to differentiate them. I opted to use tagged naming conventions like `realyushi/todo-list:backend-latest` and `realyushi/todo-list:frontend-latest`. This approach maintains logical and organized repositories without the need for multiple Docker Hub accounts.

-   **Simplifying Local Builds:** While I considered using Jenkins for local CI/CD, I realized it wasn’t necessary at this stage. Instead, I wrote a simple Makefile to streamline testing processes, complementing the user-friendly nature of Docker Compose.

-   **Version Stability in CI/CD:** A key lesson was the importance of specifying exact versions for environments in the CI/CD process, rather than relying on 'latest' versions. Choosing stable, specific versions helps avoid unexpected issues when newer versions are released.

**What I Learned Today:**

1. **GitHub Actions:** Configured CI/CD pipelines for building and testing applications.
2. **Docker Hub Deployment:** Automated the deployment of Docker images to Docker Hub via CI/CD.
3. **Secure .env Management:** Implemented strategies for securely managing environment variables.
4. **CI/CD Stability:** Understood the importance of using specific versions to ensure the CI/CD process remains stable.

The day was filled with technical insights and significant advancements in setting up a robust deployment workflow. The knowledge gained from configuring GitHub Actions and managing Docker operations will undoubtedly enhance the efficiency and security of my development process.

**CI/CD Improvements:**

-   **Handling Tests:** A key improvement in my CI/CD pipeline was learning how to manage tests that are in a 'pending' state without triggering unnecessary notifications. This adjustment helps maintain a clean and efficient workflow.

**Introduction to BDD and TDD:**

-   **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD):** I adopted BDD to align the development process more closely with user expectations and needs. This approach starts with defining behaviors from a user’s perspective, which helps in deeply understanding what the product should deliver. For the frontend, I chose Cucumber.js, and for the backend, SpecFlow.
-   **Test Development:** Although I have not yet designed the API and frontend, making it premature to write unit tests, I have started to outline feature files in BDD style. These are currently in a pending state but will soon be developed alongside the actual features.

**Tooling and Frameworks:**

-   **Vite:** I experimented with Vite to initialize the frontend project, finding it remarkably straightforward and efficient—a tool I highly recommend.

**What I Learned:**

1. **Project Initialization:** Tools like Vite make setting up new projects incredibly efficient.
2. **Docker Enhancements:** Utilized multi-stage builds in Dockerfiles and learned to manage different stages with multiple Docker Compose files.
3. **CI/CD Tactics:** Improved handling of pending tests in CI/CD pipelines to avoid unnecessary alerts.
4. **Testing Concepts:** Gained a better understanding of BDD and TDD. The user-centric approach of BDD, facilitated by tools like Cucumber and SpecFlow, makes the test specifications very accessible and user-friendly.

These three days have been foundational in shaping the project’s architecture and workflow. I’m excited to continue building on this robust framework as I move closer to developing the functional aspects of the application.
