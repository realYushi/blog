### Week 1: Setup and Initial Planning

-   **Setup Development Environment:** Install necessary software and tools on macOS.
-   **Version Control Initialization:** Set up Git repositories on GitHub, including branch management strategies.
-   **Docker Configuration:** Write Dockerfiles and docker-compose.yml for containerizing both frontend and backend.
-   **CI/CD Pipeline Setup:** Initialize CI/CD using GitHub Actions or Jenkins to automate the build, test, and deploy process.
-   **Domain-Driven Design Session:** Conduct a session to define and model the domain, identifying key entities, value objects, aggregates, and bounded contexts.
-   **Begin TDD Frameworks:** Establish TDD environments using Jest, React Testing Library for the frontend, and NUnit/xUnit for the backend. Write initial tests to guide development.

### Day 1: Setting Up My Development Environment

Today marked the beginning of my journey in building a full-stack To-Do list application. I started by refreshing my workspace—an essential step to ensure everything runs smoothly. Here's a detailed breakdown of how I set up my development environment on my MacBook M1:

1. **Resetting My System:** To start with a clean slate, I reset everything and began setting up my development tools from scratch.

2. **Terminal and Shell Configuration:**

    - **Oh My Zsh:** Installed to customize and manage my zsh configuration efficiently.
    - **Warp:** Chosen as my terminal due to its user-friendly Vim key bindings.

3. **Package Management and Software Installation:**
    - **Homebrew:** Installed as the software manager to handle various installations.
    - **Mise:** Utilized for managing different runtime versions for various projects.
    - **Visual Studio Code (VSCode):** Selected as my primary code editor. I installed several extensions to enhance functionality, though I’m still considering whether to switch to Rider IDE for .NET development. For now, VSCode remains my choice.
    - **Postman:** Installed for API testing, a new tool for me, recommended by many developers.
    - **PostgreSQL:** Set up as the development database. Plans are in place to switch to MSSQL for production.
    - **Docker:** Installed to manage and maintain containerized applications.
    - **Local Git Configuration:** Set up for version control, including connecting to GitHub via SSH.
    - **Browsers and Developer Tools:**
        - **Chromium:** Installed along with React and Redux development tools to experiment with these technologies.

Today’s focus was primarily on establishing a robust and flexible development environment that will support the diverse technologies involved in my project. By the end of the day, I successfully:

-   Reset my system and configured my terminal using Oh My Zsh.
-   Managed software installations with Homebrew and runtime versions with Mise.
-   Prepared my IDE with necessary extensions and tools for backend and frontend development.
-   Set up essential services like PostgreSQL, Docker, and Postman for effective development practices.

This setup lays a solid foundation for the weeks to come, ensuring that I have all the tools I need at my disposal to tackle the challenges of building a full-stack application.

### Day 2: Setting Up Git Repositories and Exploring Branch Management Strategies

Continuing with my development plan, today's focus shifted towards establishing a solid version control system. I took some significant steps to ensure that my project management and workflow are both efficient and effective.

**Establishing the GitHub Repository:**

-   I created a new repository for my To-Do List project, which can be found [here](https://github.com/realYushi/todo-list). Although the repository is currently empty, I'm confident it will soon be filled with the progress of my application. With ChatGPT's help, I crafted a well-structured README file to provide an overview of the project.

**Branch Management:**

-   Given that this is a solo project, I opted for a straightforward branch management strategy:
    -   **Main:** Serves as the production branch.
    -   **Development:** This is where all ongoing development will be merged and tested.
    -   **Feature/newFeature:** Used for developing new features. Once features are stable, they will be merged into the 'Development' branch and eventually into 'Main' for production.
    -   **Hotfix:** For emergency fixes, which will also follow the path of merging back to 'Main' and be deleted post-merge to maintain cleanliness in the repository.

During my research, I stumbled upon an intriguing tool called OpenCommit, which utilizes ChatGPT to analyze git diffs and generate meaningful commit messages. Intrigued by its capabilities, I decided to incorporate it into my workflow to see how AI can enhance traditional coding practices.

Additionally, I utilized gitignore.io to generate a comprehensive `.gitignore` file, ensuring that unnecessary files don’t clutter the repository.

**What I Learned Today:**

-   **Repository Setup:** I learned how to create a new repository on GitHub and link it to my local environment.
-   **Branch Management:** I gained insights into managing branches effectively for a streamlined development process.
-   **AI Integration:** Experimented with AI tools like OpenCommit to automate and refine commit messages.
-   **Project Hygiene:** Utilized tools to generate a `.gitignore` file, keeping my repository clean from unwanted files.

Today was about laying the groundwork for a seamless development process that incorporates both traditional practices and innovative AI tools. I’m excited to see how these tools will enhance my workflow as I move forward with the project.
