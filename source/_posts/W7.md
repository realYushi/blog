### Week 7: Testing, Debugging, and Deployment

-   **End-to-End Testing:** Conduct thorough end-to-end testing using both TDD and BDD methodologies.
-   **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** Get feedback from potential users and make necessary adjustments.
-   **Final Debugging and Optimization:** Address any remaining issues and optimize overall system performance.
-   **Final Deployment:** Deploy the complete application using the established CI/CD pipeline.
-   **Project Documentation:** Finalize all project documentation to ensure clarity for future maintenance and development.

### Days 1 and 2: Deploying the Backend on Azure App Service

Following the successful deployment of the frontend, I shifted my focus to deploying the backend of the To-Do List application on Azure App Service. These two days were crucial for setting up a robust environment that supports both development and production configurations.

**Setting up the Environment:**
I successfully created a .NET environment on Azure App Service and configured the CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. The setup process involved ensuring that the backend could dynamically use environment variables to configure settings like database connections and authentication keys, essential for maintaining the application's ability to run both locally and within Docker containers.

**Environment Variable Management:**
Learning how .NET Core handles environment variables was instrumental. I made necessary adjustments to the backend code to support environment-specific configurations effectively. This included setting up Docker containers to correctly reference and utilize these environment variables.

**Deployment Challenges:**
The most significant challenge came after the backend code was built and deployed to Azure; the application wouldn't run. After extensive troubleshooting, which included checking deployment logs (Kudu), logs within the application, and finally using SSH to access the Azure App Service, I discovered that the process wasn't automatically starting as expected. It turned out that the startup command needed to be explicitly set in the Azure App Service configuration. Once adjusted, the backend started functioning correctly.

**Database Integration:**
Setting up the database was straightforward. I created an Azure SQL database, retrieved the connection string, and configured it within the environment variables of the backend. This approach ensured that the backend could interact seamlessly with the database, supporting all CRUD operations required by the application.

**What I Learned:**

1. **Deploying .NET Core Apps:** Mastered the process of deploying .NET Core applications to Azure App Service, including environment setup and CI/CD integration.
2. **Environment Variable Configuration:** Learned how to configure and manage environment variables in .NET Core, essential for supporting multiple deployment environments.
3. **Docker Configuration:** Gained skills in setting up Docker containers to use environment variables, ensuring that the application remains portable and consistent across different environments.
4. **Debugging on Azure:** Developed techniques for debugging .NET Core applications directly on Azure App Service, including the use of SSH and Kudu logs.
5. **Startup Command Configuration:** Solved a critical deployment issue by configuring the startup command in Azure App Service, which was crucial for the application to run automatically upon deployment.
6. **Azure SQL Database Setup:** Streamlined the process of setting up an Azure SQL database and integrating it with the .NET Core backend.

These two days were packed with learning and overcoming deployment challenges, significantly advancing my understanding of cloud environments and application deployment strategies. The backend is now robustly configured and deployed, ready to support the frontend in a live environment.

### Days 3 and 4: Optimizing CI/CD Workflows and Solving Cookie Authentication Challenges

With the To-Do List application now operational, my focus shifted towards refining the deployment process and addressing a critical authentication challenge related to cookie management.

**Optimizing CI/CD Pipelines:**
The initial setup of the CI/CD workflows triggered a full build and deployment for every minor change pushed to the repository, regardless of whether those changes affected the frontend or backend. This was inefficient and unnecessarily increased build times and resource usage. To improve this, I delved deeper into GitHub Actions and discovered the utility of path filters. By implementing these filters, I could ensure that backend changes only triggered backend workflows, and frontend changes did the same for frontend workflows. This segmentation significantly streamlined the development process, reducing build times and minimizing resource consumption.

**Resolving Cookie Authentication Issues:**
A persistent issue with cookie-based authentication was that cookies were not being retained after login. After researching cookie management, I learned that for cookies to persist, the frontend and backend must share the same domain. This was a limitation imposed by browsers to enhance security by preventing cross-domain cookie handling.

To address this, I utilized my personal domain to create a unified domain environment for both the frontend and backend. By setting up different CNAME records pointing to each service and configuring them to share the same domain, I successfully resolved the cookie persistence issue. This adjustment allowed cookies set by the backend to be recognized and retained by the frontend, facilitating seamless authentication sessions.

**What I Learned:**

1. **GitHub Actions Path Filter:** Learned to utilize path filters within GitHub Actions to optimize CI/CD processes, ensuring that only relevant parts of the project are built and deployed based on the specific changes made.
2. **Cookie Authentication Management:** Gained insights into cookie-based authentication mechanisms, particularly the importance of domain alignment for cookie persistence across different parts of the application.
3. **Domain Configuration:** Developed skills in domain management, specifically how to configure a domain to point to multiple addresses, which is crucial for maintaining a cohesive environment between distributed services.

These enhancements not only improved the operational efficiency of the CI/CD workflows but also solidified the applicationâ€™s authentication mechanism, ensuring a more robust and user-friendly experience.
